### A/B Testing
First of all, this assignment is an in-class group project which I learned l lot from working with Data Specialist.
Super thanks and Credit to all members. :metal:

#### CONCEPT OF A/B TESTING
Before launching new products/service/ or system version, business tend to comparing two options to see which one performs better.
It's frequently seen in Creative-related job like UI in application/ website e.g. Facebook provides A/B Testing function for their Ads client.

#### STEP TO DO (in group class)
We got time less than an hour to discuss the topic, create survey form, gathering answers, analyze the results, and present :exclamation:

1. Discuss the topic
NO JOKE. We spent time the most on this part.
We had idea about whether Food Court should charge before or after eating?
AND Whether Ka-Prao (กะเพรา) with lentils (ถั่วฝักยาว) or not?
After about 20 mins past, finally P.New's idea was chosen. :laughing:

2. Create two surveys:- 
first, Ka-Prao (กะเพรา) with lentils (ถั่วฝักยาว) 
second, Ka-Prao (กะเพรา) without lentils (ถั่วฝักยาว) 
We will get rating score and surveyee basic info
*Find Ka-prao phots was another thing thing time coz we need to make sure both photos have the same standard without BIAS*

3. 40 answers have statistics results as follow.
That totally conclude that people prefer Ka-Prao (กะเพรา) without lentils (ถั่วฝักยาว) to Ka-Prao (กะเพรา) with lentils (ถั่วฝักยาว).
