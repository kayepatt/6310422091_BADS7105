Assignment 6 : Customer Segmentation

Started with the same supermarket file with 956,574 transactions as prior assignment.
ML Method, K-Means will be utilized in order to segment the customers who have similar characteristics into the same group.
I prefer to use only 2 Features which are;
1. Average Weekly Visit - Frequency aspect in RFM
2. Ticket Size - Monetary aspect in RFM

After run K-Means model via Google Big Query, I've got the following 4 customer types.

Group1 (centroid1) this is depleting grp. They come when they want with little spending.
